Go try out my website and search any soccer match from any league in the world.


# Installing:
To install the code for my project, download the zip file from my repository. Then, open a new terminal and enter 'npm init' to install all the dependencies. If you do not have npm installed, you will have to install it from Node.js. Once everything is loaded, write 'npm start' on the terminal and this will open a local server to see the website. With parcel, sometimes it takes some time or it crashes so you might have to try a couple of times. 

# Important note:
The API I used only allows me to do 100 requests per day, so if you try too many times it will stop working and it refreshes at 6:00pm (GTM-6).
